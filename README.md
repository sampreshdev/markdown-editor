Trackolap React front end.

### System Requirements

* Node.js ^8.0
* npm ^6.0

### Development

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

### Linting

Run `npm run lint` to run the linter.

### Testing

Run `npm test` to run the unit tests.

### Storybook

Run `npm run storybook` to launch the component development app. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

### Commit Message Format

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]
```

Only the **type** and **description** are mandatory.

A **scope** may be added to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis. Example: `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`

The **body** may include details and motivation for the change, if necessary.

A Jira issue number may be added to the end of the **description** or the **body**. It is prepended with a `#` and will be replaced with a link in the generated changelog. Example: `feat: add cool feature #IO-3530`

#### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, the commit message will appear in the changelog.

* **feat**: a new feature
* **fix**: a bug fix
* **docs**: documentation only changes
* **style**: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: a code change that improves performance
* **test**: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **build**: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **ci**: changes to CI configuration files and scripts
* **chore**: other changes that don't modify src or test files
* **revert**: reverts a previous commit

#### Why Use Conventional Commits?

* Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
* Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
* Communicating the nature of changes to teammates and other stakeholders.
* Triggering build and publish processes.
* Making it easier for people to contribute, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.
